\begin{Question}{1}
  Consider the following finite element
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $K$ is a triangle,
    \item $P$ is the space of polynomials of degree $\leq 2$,
    \item $N$ is the set of six nodal variables given by evaluation
      at the vertices and edge centres of $K$.
    \end{itemize}
    \BeginParts

  \qmarks{7}
  \Part{b} Give a $C^0$ geometric decomposition of this finite element,
  showing that it is $C^0$.
  \qmarks{7}

\begin{Question}{2}
  \BeginParts
\Part{a}
Write a $C^0$ finite element variational problem for the following equation,
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon u -\nabla^2 u = \exp(xy), \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0 \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega=\{x,y:0\leq x\leq 1,\, 0\leq y\leq 1\}$ with boundary
$\partial\Omega$, and $0<\epsilon<1$.
\qqmarks{6}
\Part{b}
Show that the bilinear form for the variational problem is continuous
and coercive, and give bounds for the continuity and coercivity
constants $M$ and $\gamma$ for this problem.\\ (You may make use of
the inequality $ab \leq \frac{a^2}{2}+\frac{b^2}{2}$.)  \qqmarks{6}
\Part{c}
Assuming Ce\'a's Lemma and standard interpolation error estimates,
derive an error bound for the $H^1$ error $\|u-u_h\|$ where $u_h$ is
the solution obtained by a linear Lagrange finite element approximation with maximum
mesh size $h$, and $u$ is the exact solution. What is happening to
this error bound when $\epsilon$ is very small?  \qqmarks{8} \EndParts

    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{BDM1_DOFs}}
    \caption{\label{fig:BDM1} Nodal variables diagram for Question 4.}
  \end{figure}
   In this question we consider the following finite element.
   \begin{itemize}
   \item $K$ is a triangle.
   \item $P$ are vector-valued linear functions (i.e. the $x$- and $y$-
     components of the function are both polynomials of degree $\leq 1$).
   \item The six nodal variables are the components of the function
     tangential to the edges at the locations indicated by the arrows
     in Figure \ref{fig:BDM1}.
   \end{itemize}
     \BeginParts
   \Part{a} Describe how this element can be used to construct a finite
     element space $V$ where the functions are continuous in the tangential
     component across each edge. Show that the finite element space
     does indeed have this property.
     \qmarks{6}
     \Part{b} Consider the quadratic Lagrange finite element space $P_2$.
   Show that $\phi \in P_2 \implies \nabla \phi \in V$.
   \qmarks{8}
   \Part{c} Provide a formula for the weak curl $\nabla^\perp\cdot u=-\partial u_1/\partial y + \partial u_2/\partial x$

   weak curl.  \qmarks{6} \EndParts
\end{Question}

 \begin{Question}{4}
  Let $\Omega$ be a convex polygonal domain. Assume that you have a fast and
  efficient code for solving the variational problem: find $u \in V$
  such that
  \begin{equation}
    \int_\Omega uv + \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \diff x = F[v], \quad
    \forall v \in V,
  \end{equation}
  for arbitrary linear functionals $F[v]$, where $V$ is a $C^0$ finite
  element space. However, you want to solve a different variational
  problem: find $u \in V$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:actual}
    \int_\Omega a(x) uv + b(x)\nabla u \cdot \nabla v \diff x = G[v], \quad
    \forall v \in V,
  \end{equation}
  where $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are some known functions that satisfy
  $0<\alpha< a(x) < \beta < \infty$, $0<\alpha< b(x) < \beta <
  \infty$, for all $x\in \Omega$. One possible approach is to apply
  the following iterative scheme,
  \begin{equation}
    \int_\Omega u^{k+1}v + \nabla u^{k+1} \cdot \nabla v \diff x =
    F_k[v],
    \label{eq:it}
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{equation}
    F_k[v] = \int_\Omega u^{k}v + \nabla u^{k} \cdot \nabla v \diff x
    + \mu\left(
    G[v] -
    \int_\Omega a(x) u^kv + b(x)\nabla u^k \cdot \nabla v \diff x\right)
    , \quad
    \forall v \in V,
  \end{equation}
  where $\mu>0$, for an iterative sequence $u^0,u^1,u^2,\ldots$
  of guesses at the solution.  To implement this, we choose an initial
  guess $u^0$, and then iteratively generate the sequence by solving
  \eqref{eq:it} for $u^{k+1}$ given $u^k$ (which enables us to
  construct $F_k[v]$).  \BeginParts
  \Part{a} Show that if the sequence converges to a limit $u_k \to u^*$ as
  $k\to \infty$, then $u^*$ solves Equation \eqref{eq:actual}.
  \qmarks{6}
  \Part{b}
  Defining the error $\epsilon^k = u - u^k$, where $u$ solves
  \eqref{eq:actual}, derive a variational problem that relates
  $\epsilon^{k+1}$ to $\epsilon^k$ (without explicitly involving
  $u^{k+1}$ or $u^k$).  \qmarks{6}
  \Part{c} 
  Find a
  value of $\mu$ such that
  $\|\epsilon^{k+1}\|_{H^1}<\|\epsilon^k\|_{H^1}$, concluding that
  the iterative procedure converges.
  You may make use of the stability bound from Lax-Milgram, i.e.
  the solution $u$ to a variational problem satisfies
  \begin{equation}
    \|u\|_{H^1} \leq \frac{1}{\gamma}\|F\|_{(H^1)^*},
  \end{equation}
  where $\gamma$ is the coercivity constant of the bilinear form and
  $F$ is the linear form appearing on the right hand side.

%% If you have a Mastery Question, then this should be included as an additional question 
%% on a new page. Otherwise, comment out the following three lines:
\EndPage
\begin{Question}{5}
 \BeginParts
 \Part{a} Let $V$ and $Q$ be Hilbert spaces. Let $b:V\times Q \to \mathbb{R}$ be a bilinear form.
 We define the operator $B:V\to Q'$ as follows. For each $v\in V$,
 $Bv$ is an element of $Q'$, defined by
 \begin{equation}
   (Bv)[p] = b(v,p), \, \forall p \in Q.
 \end{equation}
 For an operator $T:X\to Y'$, we define the transpose operator
 $X^*:Y\to X'$ as
 \begin{equation}
   (T^*y)[x] = (Tx)[y], \quad \forall x\in X,\,y\in Y.
 \end{equation}
 Use these definitions to derive a formula for $B^*$.
 \qmarks{6}
 \Part{b} Assuming the inf-sup condition
 \begin{equation}
   \inf_{0\neq q\in Q}\sup_{0\neq v\in V}
   \frac{b(v,q)}{\|v\|_V\|q\|_Q} \geq \beta,
 \end{equation}
 for some $\beta>0$, show that $B^*$ is injective.
 \qmarks{7}
 \Part{c}
 Let
 \begin{equation}
   b(u,p) = \int_{\Omega} p \nabla\cdot u \diff x,
 \end{equation}
 for some chosen problem domain $\Omega$ such that
 $b$ satisfies the inf-sup condition for some given finite
 element spaces $V_h$ and $Q_h$. We define the ``weak gradient''
 operator $\tilde{\nabla}:Q_h\to V_h$ such that
 \begin{equation}
   \int_\Omega w\cdot \tilde{\nabla}p\diff x
   = \int_\Omega p\nabla\cdot u \diff x.
 \end{equation}
 What does the inf-sup condition imply about the operator
 $\tilde{\nabla}$?
