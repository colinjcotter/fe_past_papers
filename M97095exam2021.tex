\begin{Question}{1}
\BeginParts
\Part{a}
Consider the finite element $(K,P,\mathcal{N})$ given by
\begin{enumerate}
\item $K$ is the $1\times 1$ square, with bottom-left corner at $(0,0)$.
\item $P$ is the polynomial space spanned by $\{1,x,y,xy\}$.
\item $\mathcal{N}=(N_1,N_2,N_3,N_4)$ where $N_i(p)=p(z_i)$ and
  $(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4)$ are the four corners of the square.
\end{enumerate}
Find the nodal basis for this finite element. (You may use a
computational linear algebra package such as Numpy or Matlab to invert
matrices but you must write the matrices that you are computing with
in your solution.)
\qmarks{8}
\Part{b}
Consider a finite element $(K,P,\mathcal{N})$ with 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $K$ is the triangle with vertices at $z_1=(0,0)$, $z_2=(1,0)$,
  and $z_3=(0,1)$.
\item $P$ is the polynomial space spanned by $\{1,x,y,xy(1-x-y)\}$,
\end{enumerate}
and nodal basis
\begin{align} \nonumber
  \psi_1 = x-9xy(1-x-y), \, \psi_2=y-9xy(1-x-y),\\ \psi_3=1-x-y-9xy(1-x-y), \, \psi_4=27xy(1-x-y).
\end{align}
\BeginParts
\Part{i}
Find a set of nodal variables $\mathcal{N}$ that corresponds
to this nodal basis, justifying your answer.
\qmarks{6}
\Part{ii}
Provide a $C^0$ geometric decomposition for this element, explaining
why it has the specified continuity.

\begin{Question}{2}
  In this question we consider the Poisson equation
  \begin{equation}
    -\nabla^2 u = f,
  \end{equation}
  on a convex domain $\Omega$ with $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$. We
  assume that $f$ is such that $u \in H^2(\Omega)$ but $u \notin
  H^3(\Omega)$.
  \BeginParts
  \Part{a} Consider Theorem 5.30 of the notes. Explain why this theorem
  is not sufficient for estimating the convergence rate for finite
  element discretisation for this problem when $k=2$.
  \qqmarks{6}
  \Part{b} For $i=1$, propose and prove a modification of Lemma 5.28 for this case.
  \qqmarks{7}
  \Part{c} For $i=1$, propose and justify (referring to existing proofs in the notes) a modification of Theorem 5.30 for this case. Comment on the difference in the estimate
  compared to the case $u\in H^3(\Omega)$.  \qmarks{7} \EndParts
\end{Question}

\begin{Question}{3} 
\BeginParts
\Part{a}
Write a finite element variational problem for the following equation,
\begin{equation}
  -\nabla^2 u = 0, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=g \mbox{ on } \partial\Omega,
\end{equation}
describing the types of finite element spaces that should be used to
ensure a unique solution.
\qqmarks{6}
\Part{b}
Consider the finite element discretisation in the case where $\Omega$
is a $1\times 1$ square and $g=\exp(\cos(x)\cos(y+x))$. Explain why
your variational problem is not possible to implement exactly on a
computer when using numerical quadrature, and propose a modification
that is.  \qqmarks{6}
\Part{c}
Adjust the statement and proof of C\'ea's Lemma to accommodate your
modification from (b), and comment on the conditions for convergence of the
finite element solution to the exact solution as the mesh is refined.
(Hints: start from the triangle inequality for
$\|u-v+v-u_h\|_{H^1(\Omega)}$ for $v\in V_h$ and then work with
the term $\|v-u_h\|_{H^1(\Omega)}$.)

\end{Question}

\begin{Question}{4}
  In this question we consider the domain displayed in Figure
  \ref{fig:boxbox}. The domain $\Omega$ is the entire square area
  shaded grey, with outer boundary $\partial\Omega$ shown as a
  continuous black line. Inside the domain is a smaller square,
  denoted $\Omega_0$, with boundary $\Gamma$, shown as a dashed black
  line. We define $\Omega_1$ to be the complement of $\Omega_0$ in
  $\Omega$.

  %\begin{figure}
    %\centerline{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{boxbox}}
    %\caption{\label{fig:boxbox} Domain for Question 4.}
  %\end{figure}
  
  We consider the following problem: find $u$ such
  that
  \begin{align}
    -\nabla^2 u = 0, \mbox{ in $\Omega_0$ and $\Omega_1$}, \\
    u = 0, \mbox{ on $\partial\Omega$}, \\
    \left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\right|_{\partial\Omega_0}
    + \left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\right|_{\partial\Omega_1\cap \Gamma} = 2,
  \end{align}
  where for a domain $\Omega_i$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial
    n}|_{\Omega_i}$ is the value of the normal component of the
  derivative restricted to $\Omega_i$, using the outward pointing
  normal to $\partial\Omega_i$. Note that since the outward pointing
  normals to $\partial\Omega_0$ and $\partial\Omega_1\cap \Gamma$ are
  equal and opposite, this condition on $\Gamma$ indicates a
  discontinuity in the normal derivative of $u$.
  \BeginParts
\Part{a}
Using the continuous Lagrange finite element space of degree $k$,
formulate a finite element discretisation for this problem.
\qmarks{6}
\Part{b}
Show that the finite element discretisation has a unique solution, and
provide a constant $\gamma$ such that the finite element solution satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \|u_h\|_{H^1(\Omega)} \leq \gamma,
\end{equation}
independently of $h$. You may quote results from the course notes
without proof.
\qmarks{8}
\Part{c}
Let $u_h$ be the numerical solution on a mesh consisting of squares
subdivided into right angled triangles, with square edge length $h$,
and let $u$ be the exact solution of the problem. Discuss the
applicability of the bound on $\|u_h-u\|_{H^1(\Omega)}$ that we
studied in the course.

%\end{figure}
 \BeginParts
\Part{a}
Let $V=(H^1(\Omega))^2$ and $Q=\mathring{L}^2(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$
is a convex polygonal domain. Let $b:V\times Q\to \mathbb{R}$ be the
bilinear form
\begin{equation}
  b(v,q) = \int_\Omega q\nabla\cdot v \diff x.
\end{equation}
Assuming the
result that the divergence is surjective from $V$ to $Q$, show
that $b$ satisfies the inf-sup condition
\begin{equation}
  \inf_{q\in Q}\sup_{v\in V}\frac{b(v,q)}{\|v\|_V\|q\|_Q} \geq \beta,
\end{equation}
for some constant $\beta$.
\qqmarks{5}
\Part{b}
Define the operator $\delta:Q \to V$ by
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega} w\cdot \delta q \diff x = b(w, q), \quad \forall w \in V.
\end{equation}
Show that the kernel of $\delta$, $\mathrm{Ker}(\delta)$, is empty.
(Hint: find a suitable choice of test function.)
\qqmarks{5}
\Part{c}
Let $V_h\subset V$ and $Q_h\subset Q$ be finite element spaces chosen for
the discretisation of Stokes' equation.  Let $\Pi_h:V\to V_h$ satisfy
condition 1 of Fortin's trick, i.e.
\begin{align}
  b(v-\Pi_hv, q) = 0, \quad \forall v\in V, \, q\in Q_h.
\end{align}
Define the discrete operator $\delta_h:Q_h \to V_h$ by
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega} w\cdot \delta_h q \diff x = b(w, q), \quad \forall w \in V_h.
\end{equation}
Show that $\mathrm{Ker}(\delta_h)\subseteq \mathrm{Ker}(\delta)$.\\
\qmarks{5}\\
       (Question continues on the following page.)
\Part{d}
Consider a mesh consisting of squares subdividing into right angle
triangles by joining the top left vertex and the bottom right vertex
of each square, and consider the discretisation for Stokes with
continuous linear Lagrange elements for each component of the velocity
and continuous linear Lagrange elements for the pressure.

By considering the function $p\in Q_h$ taking vertex values in an
alternating pattern as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:p1p1}, show that
$\mathrm{Ker}(\delta_h)\not\subseteq \mathrm{Ker}(\delta)$ in this
case. \\
Do $V_h$ and $Q_j$ satisfy condition 1 of Fortin's trick?
